Questions:

1. Explain in your own words the relationship between a deck and a card.

        The deck depends on the card.

2. Consider the deck initialized with the statements below. How many cards does the deck contain?
        
        String[] ranks = {"jack", "queen", "king"};
        String[] suits = {"blue", "red"};
        int[] pointValues = {11, 12, 13};
        Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
 
        The deck contains two cards.
 
3.  The game of Twenty-One is played with a deck of 52 cards. Ranks run from ace (highest) down to 2
    (lowest). Suits are spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs as in many other games. A face card has 
    point value 10; an ace has point value 11; point values for 2, ?, 10 are 2, ?, 10, respectively. 
    Specify the contents of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays so that the statement 

        Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
        
    initializes a deck for a Twenty-One game.
    
    String[] ranks = {"ace", "king","queen", "jack", "ten", "nine", "eight", "seven", "six", "five", "four", "three", "two"};
    String[] suits = {"spades", "hearts", "diamonds", "clubs"};
    int[] pointValues = {11, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2};
    
    

4. Does the order of elements of the ranks, suits, and pointValues arrays matter? 
    
    yes
