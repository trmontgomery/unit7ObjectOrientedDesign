Questions: 

1.  All three games involve the user selecting and replacing cards, adding up the cards they selected,
    and the rules to terminate each game are the same. The games differ in the point value that you add
    two cards to and which higher valued card(s) can be removed.  You are also allowed to remove a quartet 
    of similarly ranked cards in Thirteens, a type of move that is unique to this game alone.  
    
2.  Because the ElevensBoard extends the Board class, all of the instance variables declared in the Board 
    class are inherited by the ElevensBoard class.  The variables are intialized after calling the super()
    constructor in the ElevensBoard constructor.
    
3.  Yes, it does because they allow the new boards to determine what is defined as a legal move in the
    isLegal() method, and change how many cards are played or are on the board at a time.
